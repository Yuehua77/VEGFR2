Implementation Plan - Data Preparation Reproduction
Goal Description
Update the data collection and processing pipeline to strictly follow the methodology described in the paper "Discovery of novel VEGFR2 inhibitors against non-small cell lung cancer based on fingerprint-enhanced graph attention convolutional network". This involves strict binary classification thresholds, adding A549 cell line data, generating specific molecular features (ECFP4 + Graph features), and implementing a negative sampling strategy.

Proposed Changes
Data Collection
[MODIFY] 
collect_vegfr2_data.py
Update 
VEGFR2DataCollector
 to also collect data for A549 cell line (Target ID: CHEMBL3307651).
Implement merging logic to combine VEGFR2 and A549 data.
Ensure data structure supports multi-task labels (VEGFR2 activity and A549 activity).
Data Processing
[MODIFY] 
process_existing_data.py
Implement strict binary classification logic:
Active (1): IC50 < 1 uM (pIC50 > 6.0)
Inactive (0): IC50 > 10 uM (pIC50 < 5.0)
Drop intermediate values (1-10 uM).
Implement negative sampling strategy (random selection from ChEMBL or decoy generation) to balance the dataset.
Clean up the script to handle the new multi-task data format.
Feature Generation
[NEW] 
generate_features.py
Create a new script to generate model inputs.
Fingerprints: Generate 1024-bit ECFP4 fingerprints.
Graph Features: Generate node features (atom type, degree, charge, etc.) and edge features (bond type, conjugation, etc.) using RDKit.
Save features in .npy or .pkl format for PyTorch.
Verification Plan
Automated Verification
Create a verification script verify_data_prep.py to:
Check that vegfr2_processed.csv contains only 0 and 1 labels (no intermediates).
Verify that A549 data is present (check for A549 columns or rows).
Verify that generated feature files exist and have correct shapes (e.g., fingerprint dimension 1024).
Check class balance to verify negative sampling effect.
Manual Verification
Run 
collect_vegfr2_data.py
 (with a small limit for testing) and inspect the output CSV.
Run 
process_existing_data.py
 and inspect the output CSV.
Run generate_features.py and check the output files.
